TODO:
    - parse `largs` from record to IOOP

- `tstart` (timestamp start):
    - The precise time (in microseconds or nanoseconds) when the function call began.
    - Used to determine ordering and performance of operations.
- `tend` (timestamp end)
    - The time when the function call completed.
- `level`
    - Call level in the call stack, indicating nested function depth.
    - Helps reconstruct hierarchical call sequences or group related events.
- `func_names[func_id]`
    - The name of the function invoked (e.g., read, fopen, MPI_File_write_all.
    - Using Local Log to fetch this information.
    - func_id is an index into the function name table maintained by Recorder.
- `tid` (thread ID)
    - The thread (or rank) that made the call.
    - Useful for parallel analysis and distinguishing per-thread behavior.
- `arg_count`
    - The number of arguments recorded for the function call.
    - Varies based on the function (e.g., write(fd, buf, count) has 3 arguments).
- `args`
    - Raw argument values (e.g., file descriptor, buffer address, size).
    - May include pointers, flags, sizes, offsets.
- `largs` (long arguments or logical arguments)
    - Often a stringified or interpreted form of args.
    - Provides human-readable info, such as resolved filenames, access modes, buffer sizes.
